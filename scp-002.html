                <h2>Special Containment Procedures</h2>
                <p>SCP-002 is to remain connected to a suitable power supply at all times, to keep it in what appears to
                    be a recharging mode. In case of electrical outage, the emergency barrier between the object and the
                    facility is to be closed and the immediate area evacuated. Once facility power is re-established,
                    alternating bursts of X-ray and ultraviolet light must strobe the area until SCP-002 is re-affixed
                    to the power supply and returned to recharging mode. Containment area is to be kept at negative air
                    pressure at all times.</p>
                <p>Teams including a minimum of two (2) members are required within 20 meters of SCP-002 or its
                    containment area. Personnel should maintain physical contact with one another at all times to
                    confirm there is another person present, as perception may be dulled, skewed, or influenced by
                    proximity to the object.</p>
                <p>No personnel below Level 3 are permitted within SCP-002. This requirement may be waived via written
                    authorization from two (2) off-site Level 4 administrators. Command staff issued such a waiver must
                    be escorted by at least five (5) Level 3 Security personnel for the duration of their contact and
                    must temporarily surrender their rank and security clearance.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>SCP-002 resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of roughly 60 m³ (or 2000 ft³). An iron valve hatch
            on one side leads to its interior, which appears to be a standard low-rent apartment of modest size. One
            wall of the room possesses a single window, though no such opening is visible from the exterior. The room
            contains furniture which, upon close examination, appears to be sculpted bone, woven hair, and various other
            biological substances produced by the human body. All matter tested thus far show independent or fragmented
            DNA sequences for each object in the room.</p>
        <p>Refer to the <a href="#report">Mulhausen Report</a> for details related to object's discovery.</p>

        <h2>References</h2>
        <p>To date, subject has been responsible for the disappearances of seven personnel. It has also in its time at
            the facility further furnished itself with two lamps, a throw rug, a television, a radio, a beanbag chair,
            three books in an unknown language, four children's toys, and a small potted plant. Tests with a variety of
            lab animals including higher primates have failed to provoke a response in SCP-002. Cadavers as well fail to
            produce any effect. Whatever process the subject uses to convert organic matter into furnishings is
            apparently only facilitated by the introduction of living humans</p>
