                <p>SCP-003 is to be maintained at a constant temperature of no less than 35°C and ideally kept above
                    100°C. No living multicellular organisms of Category IV or higher complexity may be allowed to come
                    into contact with SCP-003.</p>
                <p>In event of total power failure, if SCP-003-1 begins to increase its mass, assigned personnel must
                    engage in skin contact with SCP-003-1. Ideally, personnel may use their body heat to return
                    SCP-003-1 to above the critical temperature; however, skin contact must be maintained even in event
                    of SCP-003 reaching activation temperature, lasting at minimum until SCP-003-1 advances fully to its
                    second growth stage.</p>
                <p>Personnel who enter SCP-003's containment area must first be examined for body parasites of Category
                    IV or higher complexity, and sterilized if such organisms are present. All personnel who have come
                    in physical contact with SCP-003-1 are to immediately report for sterilization afterwards.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>SCP-003 consists of two related components of separate origin, referred to as SCP-003-1 and
                    SCP-003-2.</p>
                <p>SCP-003-1 appears to be composed of chitin, hair, and nails of unknown biology, arranged in a
                    configuration similar to that of a computer motherboard. Testing reveals SCP-003-1 to predate
                    earliest known circuit boards by a factor of thousands of years. SCP-003-1 is considered sentient
                    but not actively dangerous except under certain conditions.</p>
                <p>SCP-003-1 was found on a stone tablet, SCP-003-2, on which it currently resides. The runes on
                    SCP-003-2 are not part of any known language and emit pale, flickering light patterns.</p>

                <h4>SCP-003-2 Details</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>SCP-003-2 is controlled by a (non-biological) internal computer, the contents of which are mostly
                    inaccessible without risk of damaging SCP-003-2. SCP-003-2 is capable of controlled emissions of
                    radiation, including heat, light, and anomalous radiation types. SCP-003-2 contains an internal
                    power source of an anomalous nature, which appears to have been losing power since several centuries
                    before discovery.</p>
                <p>It is considered probable that SCP-003-2 was created for the purpose of containing SCP-003-1.
                    Partially interpreted data recovered from SCP-003-2 may refer to a past and/or potential future
                    LK-class restructuring event caused by SCP-003-1.</p>

                <h4>Discovery and Remote Viewing</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>SCP-003 was located by remote viewing team SRV-04 Beta. It appears possible that SRV-04 Beta was
                    deliberately contacted by SCP-003-2. Other organizations have also been alerted to SCP-003's
                    existence, possibly by similar means. Despite this activity, SCP-003-2 does not appear to be
                    sentient, based on its lack of reaction to M03-Gloria analysis and procedures.</p>

                <h4>Reaction to Temperature</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>When SCP-003 drops below the temperature of 35°C, both components react.</p>
                <p>First, SCP-003-1 enters a growth state characterized by an exponential increase in mass. This growth
                    state consists of two stages. In both stages, SCP-003-1 partially fuels its growth by converting
                    matter around it, starting with any surrounding inorganic material, including atmospheric elements,
                    then nonliving organic material, including cells of dead skin, hair, chitin, enamel, keratin, and
                    other biological materials.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card custom-card">
            <div class="card-header custom-card-header">
                <h4>Growth Stages</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>The first stage is always the same. SCP-003-1 will first increase its mass, then take a form similar
                    in shape to an ophiuroid (brittle star) of fifteen meters in diameter (including what appears to be
                    a central processor of three meters in diameter). It will form sensory organs that appear to scan
                    its surrounding environment, and will partially convert the area around it to an unidentified
                    anomalous substance (SCP-003-2 seems immune from conversion).</p>
                <p>The second stage describes a growth alteration which occurs when SCP-003 comes into contact with
                    living organic material; SCP-003 appears to "template" itself off of the organic material, and will
                    attempt communication with organisms that match its initial "template" or "templates".</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card custom-card">
            <div class="card-header custom-card-header">
                <h4>Further Analysis</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>In its second stage, SCP-003-1 may pause, slow or change its growth, and will also convert inorganic
                    and nonliving organic elements into functionally similar structures while anomalously altering their
                    physical makeup.</p>
                <p>While growth is consistent in the first stage, in the second stage SCP-003-1's growth rate is
                    diminished by 20-90% so long as SCP-003-1 remains in contact with living organic material. The
                    percentage is determined by the complexity of the organism(s) in contact with SCP-003-1; SCP-003-1
                    appears to devote a large amount of processing power to analysis of living organic material.</p>

        <div class="card custom-card">
            <div class="card-header custom-card-header">
                <h4>Containment and Procedures</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>During each of SCP-003-1's growth stages, SCP-003-2 releases bursts of radiation that temporarily
                    inhibit SCP-003-1's growth, or reverse this growth when the temperature of SCP-003-1 rises above
                    100°C. Similar radiation emissions have been replicated or recorded via other anomalous means.</p>
                <p>SCP-003-1's biology has been the subject of extensive study. Significant elements have been
                    identified similar to SCP-███, SCP-1512, and SCP-2756, the latter two of which have no further
                    confirmed connection with SCP-003-1 and no known connection with each other, and none of which are
                    fully understood (technically, even less understood than SCP-003, thanks to the extensive
                    cross-disciplinary research on the SCP-003 objects).</p>
