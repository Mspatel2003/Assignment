                <h2>Special Containment Procedures</h2>
                <p>When handling items SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13, proper procedure is vital. The items are not
                    permitted to be moved off-site unless accompanied by two Level 4 security personnel. Under no
                    circumstances should any other component of SCP-004 be taken through SCP-004-1. The effects of doing
                    so are as yet unknown, and the current cost of experimentation makes further research impractical.
                    Should any of the objects contained within SCP-004-1 breach containment, or the facility be
                    breached, the keys must be brought inside and the door closed prior to activation of Site 62’s
                    on-site warhead. Unauthorized removal of keys from the testing area is grounds for immediate
                    termination.</p>
                <p><strong>Level 1 clearance is required for basic access to SCP-004-1; Level 4 clearance is required
                        for use of SCP-004-2 to -13.</strong></p>

        <h2>Space-Time Anomalies</h2>
        <p>SCP-004 seems to propagate spatiotemporal anomalies. Personnel leaving the facility report losing time. Those
            who have been in the site for weeks insist that they had only been in the facility for several days, and
            records of work completed and supplies consumed support their claims. Other temporal anomalies involve
            SCP-004-2 through -13, especially the reappearance of SCP-004-CAS01 and SCP-004-CAS02 exactly years after
            using SCP-004-. has been assigned to investigate all aspects of these time anomalies.
            Spatial anomalies include the impossibly large dimensions of the area opened by SCP-004-7. Similarly, the
            2003 blackout incident suggests that there exists an alternate plane of existence within the same space that
            Site-62 occupies.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="container no-padding">
        <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
        <p>Testing on SCP-004 reveals that ten of the keys open SCP-004-1 on a dimension where the laws of physics and
            topology are significantly different than those of our home dimension. Test subjects meeting these hostile
            conditions are torn apart, their body parts deposited in various locations, only three of which have been
            verified to be on Earth. Material deposited at two of these points appears immediately; material deposited
            at the third appears exactly years into the future. The other seven locations are currently unknown.</p>
        <p>
            Current testing focuses on two avenues of research. The first is finding ways to survive SCP-004’s hostile
            topologies. The second [DATA EXPUNGED] suggest that SCP-004-2 through -13 may open doors other than
            SCP-004-1.

        <h2>Appendix A<span class="doc">Mental Health Effects of SCP-004-12</span></h2>
        <p>All Class D personnel using SCP-004-12 return in a catatonic state, unable to speak. Some may have enough
            energy left to try to claw out their eyes. Of the 16 subjects, only 4 have survived. Only one has regained
            speech, following long-term psychotherapy. He was able to tell the psychiatrist that he saw a massive green
            creature, so large that much of its body extended beyond his field of view. He reported innate fear and
            sudden recognition, “as if it were something buried deep in [his] primal fears,” and forced implantation of
            “incomprehensible” memories. Subject displays acute anterograde and retrograde amnesia.</p>
